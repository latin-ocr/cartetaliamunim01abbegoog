A large number ot the documento here printed are derived from
. the famssy papers oi the late Dr. Curru, of st. Donat's Oastle, und
from the oolleotion of the late ΜΓ. G. G. meses, of Svansea, to both

ot whom I desire to express my obligations Others vvere found in the -

Harleian Oolleotion in the Brilish Museum, and others among tlre

voluminous family pepers of ΜΓ. Jonas, ol Fonmon Oustle. The
originnls of the Borough Charters areetOerdili,Ilant1issant, andKenfig,
exoepting those of Aberavon, lor whieh I am indebted to my friend Sir
H. Hrssnr Vrvrsr, long a representative ot our Oounty in Purliament.
Ihave also to thanlr Mr. W. nn Guar Bruonolor ealling my attention
to many of the Museum Oharters, end for his assistance in oorrooting
my proofs‚ and thus preventing many errors.

In my former as in the present volume, the oontente are arranged
in order oi time, or, in the absenoe of dates, as nearly so as vvas pruo-
tiaable, and the series ol doouments in the present volume is oontinued
down to the reigns ot Eurzanurrr end laune, with a few not unimportant
additions. It has however happened, during the printing of this seoond
volume, that e mess of dooumentr, ohielly of the l2th und leth oenturies,
have oome under my uotiua, the number ot vhioh, their dates, end their
importunae in Glemorgan history, have rendered neoessary a third volume,
whioh vill be of the nature of un appendix to the former two, and
whioh will, with them, I hope, torm a very eomplete oolleotion of the
ohurters end early muniments relating to the Imdships oi Glamorgan,
Kilvne, and (lower.

Tauranus, Summanu, 1890.
