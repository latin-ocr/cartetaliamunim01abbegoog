This oharter ie clearly written, upon parchment 21 in. broad by 16 in.
deep, occasionally worn away by frequent solding, but otherwise fairly
legible.

The ee& now much chipped and worn, hae been a. very handeome one,
of about 3} in. diameter, eut with unusual olem-nese and *boldneeffi and
formed of very dumble green wax. The margin is gone, but the nenti-al
part is tolerably perfect. Upon the one side is an armed knight riding to
tho proper left, and upon his small full-bostomed ehield the arms of
Bennohamp and Ν ewburgh (called Guy, Earl of Warwiok), quartu-ly.
The ceper-isone of the horse have been emblazoned„ but are worn so

nearly smooth that only traces of le Despenoer quartem-ing de Clare ean
be deheo'oed. ’
